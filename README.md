# odin-recipes
My first HTML project!
I will be creating a recipe website which involves a main index page and links to the recipes in the website. I should be able to incorporate basic skills of HMTL such as elements and tags, boilerplate, working with text, lists and links and images. As previously learned in the oden project HTML Foundations.
Expectations are some sort of initial struggle before an easier building up after getting into the flow of things.



I finished my project! on 31/01/2022. It was a lot easier than i thought it would be and revieiwng the git pages, html foundations pages, I found almost no problems in completing the assignment.

One thing to note, placing an S on the end of <li></li> in the format of <li><S/li> cut the proceeding thhe text with a line through. This confused me for a second before i was able to correct it by looking through the code around where the issue was.
Working with the website on the side was very useful in finding any issues or problems and tweaking the final product.
