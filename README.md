# odin-recipes
My first HTML project!
I will be creating a recipe website which involves a main index page and links to the recipes in the website. I should be able to incorporate basic skills of HMTL such as elements and tags, boilerplate, working with text, lists and links and images. As previously learned in the oden project HTML Foundations.
Expectations are some sort of initial struggle before an easier building up after getting into the flow of things.
